1. **Report Markdown File**:
   - You were generating a markdown report for an audio transcription process. The report included:
     - A clickable file link to the original audio file.
     - A Table of Contents (ToC) with links to transcription chunks.
     - Sectioned content such as keywords, audio player embedding, and transcription chunks.

2. **Issues Faced**:
   - The clickable file link to the audio file (using `file://`) was not resolving correctly.
   - Encoding spaces and special characters in the file path was problematic, as it required converting spaces to `%20` and ensuring proper formatting (e.g., converting `\` to `/` and handling the `C:` drive on Windows).

3. **Current Progress**:
   - You tried encoding the file path correctly and formatting it for compatibility with `file://`.
   - Despite the adjustments, the links were not working as expected, indicating potential formatting or encoding inconsistencies.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Since markdown formatting for the report is proving challenging, you are considering transitioning to HTML for generating the report:
     - HTML would allow more control over file linking, embedding, and styling.
     - You can integrate elements like clickable file links and audio players more seamlessly.
